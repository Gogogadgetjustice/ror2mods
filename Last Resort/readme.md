Bottom Line Up Front: Last Resort it a highly configurable Risk of Rain 2 mod that defaults to giving players a second chance when they're about to die. 

## But at what cost?

Out of the box, when your health drops below a threshold (default 25%), Last Resort automatically activates the following:  
+ Heals you back up (default: 100%)  
+ Grants temporary invulnerability (default: 3 seconds)  
- Sacrifices some items for your survival (default: 10%, favors uncommon green items)  
- Spawns enemies nearby (default start: 1 blazing beetle, 1 Void Infestor, 1 greater Wisp)   
- Gives the Combat Director bonus credits to spawn more enemies  
- Has a cooldown before it can trigger again (default: 10 seconds)  

Risk of Options opens up all sorts of absurd possibilities.   
You can make it training wheels mode for new players or suffering for veterans who want an extra chance and/or brutal consequences.

---===---===---===---

There comes a point in every survivor’s career when Petrichor V squints at them, checks the paperwork, and says: “You should be dead.”  

The weary and damaged survivor thinks “Self-preservation? Surely that’s for people with a plan. I'm a busy mom on the go. There has to be a better way!”  

Don't politely die as your next inevitable step after a series of repetitive blows.   

A world of possibility awaits you.  

Through the power of the Last Resort system, you likely get to live, you lucky duck, but why? At what cost?  

The Last Resort system intervenes when you take a hit that drops your health below an  
arbitrary percentage of your choice.  

Your health can then instantly reset to the percentage of your choice.   

The odds of death are slim but never zero.  

In fact, reaching zero or less HP ends your delay of the inevitable.   

Martyrdom isn't so bad.  

Just look at all the trinkets you gathered.  

Death might be comparatively merciful depending on how you set up the further consequences for defying the will of the universe and natural order to all things.  

These consequences can be adjusted to taste. Several templates are provided for ease of use.  

You choose your own adventure really.   

Perhaps items are sacrificed for your survival.   
Perhaps the invisible hand of the director receives a small gratuity that increases the more you bumble.  
Perhaps endless swarms of extremely motivated creatures are dispatched to your general vicinity until you learn the dangers of recreational cliff diving.

Last Resort watches your health with the same existential dread that Mithrix feels when you hop on up to the platform.  
When things get critically uncomfortable, Last Resort steps in. How hard the Petrichor V pushes back, and what it pushes, is up to you.  

You might end up:

* the monster concierge turning every near-death experience into a crowd control problem,  
* the protagonist in a long-form morality play about item loss and consequences,  
* a glowing immortal on a cakewalk test of how many creatures your rig can handle before the game becomes a slideshow crash out,  
* someone who keeps barely defying death in ways that are as statistically improbable as they are delightful. That is a threat.  

Maybe it's a safety net. Maybe it's an investment in chaos. Maybe she's born with it.

Last Resort exposes its controls through Risk of Options.   

There are 7 submenus, organized so that each section answers a single, sensible question, usually followed by a less sensible outcome.  

_.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._  
+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+  
+-+H+ Menu 1. Activation   +H+-  
-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H  

* **Health Threshold (1-99%)**  
  When your HP dips below this percentage, Last Resort *tries* to do something. Whether that something is help or hilarity depends on the rest of your settings.  

* **Enable Healing** Toggling this checkbox tells Last Resort whether it’s allowed to patch you up at all.  For those that just want a monster parade without personal benefit.

* **Heal To Percent (1-99%)**
  How healthy you are after intervention.
  Set high for mercy. Set low for drama. 
  [Pro Tip: If you hate yourself, set the threshold to 99% and Heal to 20%.]

* **Item Loss Percent (0-100%)**
  The price of paperwork. A slice of your inventory gets left behind at the doorstep of the abyss with varying degree of malice. A percentage of your total items is removed each activation. Larger inventories incur larger fees.

* **Item Tier Priority**
  Influences which items are more likely to be removed: White, Green, Red, Boss, Lunar, Void, or set to Random to have Petrichor shrug and blindly flick items away. 

* **Cooldown (Seconds)**
  Prevents or enables Last Resort firing repeatedly in rapid succession. The system has been designed to save you and then expects you to sort yourself out. Can you hear that? The burden of free will laughs in our faces.

* **Invulnerability Duration (Seconds)**
  A short grace period to stop the intervention from immediately retriggering itself and give you time to make your escape. You glow yellow while it is active. 

  You could stack the cooldown lower than this but everyone agrees that would be embarrassing stab at nigh immortality.

* **Player Enable / Disable Lists**
  Control who is subject to Last Resort:

  * everyone
  * only specific players
  * everyone except specific players

  * Use Case #1: Playing with friends of different skill levels.
    Enable For All Players: No
    Enabled Player Names: "CasualFriend,NewPlayer"
    Disabled Player Names: "VeteranPlayer,WastedLifeOnGaming"
  * Use Case #2: Be a real jerk to that one guy. He knows what he did.

+-+H+ 2. Director Credits   +H+-
-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H+-+H

### **2. 

How annoyed does Petrichor get about all these death defying shenanigans?

* **Minimum Base Pay**
  Credits always awarded to the Combat Director when Last Resort activates.

* **Multiple Activation Kickback**
  Additional credits that scale with *how many times* a player has already triggered Last Resort. The more often you cheat death, the *richer* the Director gets

  The first few interventions can slip by, barely tolerated. By the fifth or sixth, plenty of heavy hitters are deployed to correct the clerical oversight of your continued existence.

  Note this does not touch the spawning combat system. All the normal rules apply. It just thickens the density and challenge.

### **Sub-Menus 3, 4, 5. Enemy Slots**

Additional creatures outside the director bonuses are also available. These three submenus control which special agents shows up when you survive a near–fatal narrative event. What, exactly, is dispatched in particular to deal with the situation?

Each slot defines a separate enemy package. You can disable slots, stack them, or use all three to build something truly inadvisable.

* **Enemy Preset**
  A curated list of known enemies for convenience and safety.
  Pick a canonical creature from the local fauna.

* **Custom Master Name**
  Used only if the Enemy Preset is set to `Custom` for your own custom nightmare when you’re feeling experimental.. Enables modded spawns. Lets you add creatures that didn't make the list. You can typically ignore this option. Enemy Preset always has priority. 

* **Elite Type**
  None, standard elites, Lunar, Void, etc.

* **Base Count**
  This minimum number of enemies spawn on each activation.

* **Bring More Friends to the Party?**
  Enables scaling with repeated activations. More survival more problems. 

* **Party Crasher Escalation Rate**
  How many additional enemies are added per activation after the first.

Slots scale independently and server host can change them on the fly, which means you can:

* add nuisance enemies early,
* introduce elites later,
* or quietly turn near-death experiences into boss conventions.

### **6. Templates**

**Prewritten bad ideas.**

Not sure how to configure all the knobs? These presets are fill-in-the-blanks scenarios. You can still edit their individual settings to taste.

They overwrite multiple settings across all submenus at once to create coherent experiences
and reduce the amount of time you spend fiddling through the buttons.

* **Training Wheels** – Survival with minimal consequences. 
* **Devil’s Bargain** – The intended baseline
* **Harsh Consequences** – Escalation is the point
* **Boss Rush** – Three elite bosses that will bring their cousins to this party
* **Void Infection** – Everything is worse and purple
* **Oops! All False Sons** – The False Sons start coming and they don't stop coming

There's countless other potential variants so these were chosen for fun times and ease of swapping out.

Yes, the monsters still spawn at the Bazaar. They mostly plunge to their death. It is unsettling.

---

### **7. Chat & Logs**

This lets you decide whether Last Resort is a quiet background system, a narrated escalation,
or a debugging confessional. This controls visibility, not mechanics.

* **Chat Notifications On/Off**
    Master switch for broadcast messages.
    Let the rest of the lobby know who just survived again. Or don’t. 
    It’s your existential nightmare.

* **Credits Added (Chat)**
  Shows how much the Director earned from your reduced health.

* **Total Enemies Added (Chat)**
  Shows how many enemies were spawned.

* **Number / Types of Each Enemy Added (Chat)**
   Keeps track of just how many entities you’ve cursed into existence.

* **Logging Verbosity**

  * **Minimal** – One concise activation message.
  * **Verbose** – Full breakdown if you like keeping receipts: scaling, spawns, elites, credits.

-----

Last Resort came to existence after a combination of poor luck, cosmic bureaucracy, and a very beleaguered survivor who insisted it was healthier to automate self-healing with severe consequences instead of burying the dead alongside the trauma of exiguous success and calling it a day. 

Now go forth and save runs, ruin runs, create monsters, become a monster.
